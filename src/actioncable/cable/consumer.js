/*
# The Cable.Consumer establishes the connection to a server-side Ruby
  Connection object. Once established,
# the Cable.ConnectionMonitor will ensure that its properly maintained through
  heartbeats and checking for stale updates.
# The Consumer instance is also the gateway to establishing subscriptions to
  desired channels through the #createSubscription
# method.
#
# The following example shows how this can be setup:
#
#   @App = {}
#   App.cable = Cable.createConsumer "ws://example.com/accounts/1"
#   App.appearance = App.cable.subscriptions.create "AppearanceChannel"
#
# For more details on how you'd configure an actual channel subscription, see Cable.Subscription.
